# This is Day 01 of learning C++

01. we can execute our code in terminal with the following command
```powershell
g++ <file-name.cpp> -o <executable-file-name.exe>
```
This will create a `<executable-file-name.exe>` which we can run in the terminal

02. we use `cout` to print a string on the terminal
```c++
cout << "Hello World" ;
```
