*SO from today, I am starting my journey with c++ programming language.*

And I started my journey with finalising the resources.

## Documentation
I looked for many c++ documentations and at the end, I liked this one ~
[cplusplus](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/program_structure/)

And yeah, I know I am still in the learning phase of *"How to read documentations properly"* , that's why I'll be using *google* , especially *GFG* and *w3schools* , anytime I am stucked at something. Because they give on the point solutions very easily.

And yeah, don't forget ChatGPT.

## Lectures
SO this was the most difficult task, because there are many teachers online teaching on a very awesome level.

It was hard for me to shortlist, but I tried my best!

01. CodeWithHarry Bhaia
    - Obviously, he helped me in falling in love with coding. And without him, I don't want to start this journey.
    - I have learned C and python from him.

02. Hitesh Choudhary Sir
    - Recently I have started learning python from his freshly launched series *chai aur code* . Though I already know basic and a little intermediate python, but learning from him is a whole different experience.
    - I know sometimes my way of learning will collide with his way of teaching, because I follow a different path from his. But lets' see....

03. Aman Dhattarwal Bhaia
    - So I have personally not learned any programming language from him yet, because I never felt the need. 
    - But I have learned various concepts of *Physics* from him. And his way of teaching is a lot differernt from other teachers, and the best thing, it somewhat aligns with my way of learning.

04. BroCode
    - This was a new youtube channel that I have found, and the person behind this channel teaches in a very simple to understand way.
    - I found him first with his python video, and the way he was teaching, very simple. So yeah.

05. Saurabh Sir
    - It was a recommendation from my Senior, that you should visit Saurabh sir's channel becuase his understanding on both the theory and practical part of a language is just out of this world.
    - So I will also be looking to learn from him, especially for the pitfalls to avoid. Because he's so experienced in that.
